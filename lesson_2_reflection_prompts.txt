What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create git metadata. You need to track your files for commit.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
In staging area are only the files tracked for your commit. It is useful to separe the logical changes instead of keeping track of all your files blindly.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You control the files you want to add in the staging area, so the commit is only these files.
