When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To have backup, work from multiple computers or working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the pulls are automatic, we don't know when changes are applied to our code, making confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branching is the standard GIT way of creating changes to a working project. Cloning is useful when you want to have multiple copies of the code. Forking is a special feature from GitHub, for when you want to make a copy of a repository which you can't change.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It is a way to know which changes were made at the remote repository and it is useful for working offline on conflicts.
